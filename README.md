# MarkLogic NiFi connector

The MarkLogic NiFi connector simplifies integrating [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) with MarkLogic, allowing for 
data to be easily written to and read from MarkLogic. The connector consists of a set of custom NiFi processors and 
controller services which can be used in NiFi flows for integrating with MarkLogic. The connector has been developed 
and tested on NiFi 1.15.3; it may work in more recent versions of NiFi too. 

Please see the [Getting Started guide](https://marklogic.github.io/nifi/getting-started) 
for information on obtaining the connector, installing it, and using it. 

For information on developing the connector and contributing pull requests for it, please see 
[the contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

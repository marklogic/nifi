The MarkLogic connector consists of two types of NiFi components - a controller service, and multiple processors.
The controller service defines the details for connecting to a MarkLogic server, while the processors perform a
variety of functions focused primarily on moving data into and out of MarkLogic.

The list of processors in the MarkLogic connector can be viewed by dragging a new processor onto the NiFi canvas
and entering the word "MarkLogic" into the search box that NiFi displays. The "Add Processor" dialog in NiFi will
show a description for each processor. Once a processor has been added to the canvas, full documentation for the
processor can be viewed by right-clicking on it and selecting "View Usage".
